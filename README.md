# Breast Cancer Dataset Analysis

This repository contains the **Data Analytics and Mining project** developed during the Erasmus program at Nova FCT in Lisbon in Big Data Analytics and Engineering.

## Description

**Breast cancer dataset** 

[Breast Cancer dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/14/breast+cancer) is a widely used dataset in machine learning and data science that contains information computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. 
The aim of the project is to perform four main tasks: 

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Regression Analysis
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Clustering

## Repository Overview

In this repository, in the root level, you can find the pdf report and a folder **\code**s which gather the jupyter notebooks where the tasks are solved.
