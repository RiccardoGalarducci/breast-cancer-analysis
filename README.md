# Breast Cancer Dataset Analysis

This repository contains the Data Analytics and Mining project developed during the Erasmus program at Nova FCT in Lisbon in Big Data Analytics and Engineering.

## Description

**Breast cancer dataset** is a widely used dataset in machine learning and data science that contains information computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The aim of this report is to analyze the result we have obtained while performing four main tasks: 
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Regression Analysis
- Principal Component Analysis
- Clustering

## Repository Overview

In this repository, in the root level, you can find the pdf version of the report and a folder **\code**s which gather the jupyter notebooks.
